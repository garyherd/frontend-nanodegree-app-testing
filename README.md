# Feed Reader Testing

This is Project #6 of the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)

The goal of this project was, given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds, to write a battery of tests to verify the functionality of the application. Testing was done using the Jasmine Framework.

`git clone https://github.com/garyherd/frontend-nanodegree-app-testing.git`

2. Navigate to the root directory of the project, and open the 'index.html' file.
